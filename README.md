# OpenCoreLocation

OpenCoreLocation is a work-in-progress library developed by **Ezequiel (Kimi) Aceto** with the goal of bringing Apple's **CoreLocation** functionality to **Linux**.

## Project Status
This project is currently under active development, aiming to create a fully compatible CoreLocation API for Linux environments. The implementation focuses on maintaining the same API and behavior as Apple's CoreLocation, making it easier to port applications to Linux.

## Roadmap
- [x] Implement CoreLocation enums and basic structures.
- [x] Implement `CLLocationManager` and `CLLocationManagerDelegate` classes.
- [x] Implement `CLGeocoder` class.
- [ ] Add support for more advanced location services (e.g., region monitoring, heading updates).
- [ ] Implement more accuracy-based providers for different use cases.
- [ ] Extensive testing and validation on Linux distributions.
