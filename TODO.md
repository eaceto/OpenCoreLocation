⏺ Based on my review of your OpenCoreLocation implementation, here are
  the missing and incomplete features compared to Apple's CoreLocation
  framework:

  🔴 Critical Missing Features

  1. Real Location Providers

  - Currently only uses IP-based geolocation (ipinfo.io) with ~20km
  accuracy
  - No GPS, WiFi positioning, or cellular triangulation support
  - No integration with system location services on Linux
  - Missing providers for different accuracy levels (only
  LowAccuracyLocationProvider exists)

  2. Region Monitoring

  - startMonitoring(for:) and stopMonitoring(for:) methods not
  implemented
  - No actual geofencing capability despite having
  CLRegion/CLCircularRegion classes
  - Missing delegate callbacks: didEnterRegion, didExitRegion,
  didDetermineState
  - monitoredRegions property exists but no monitoring logic

  3. Background Location Updates

  - allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates property exists but not functional
  - No actual background location monitoring
  - pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically not implemented

  🟡 Partially Implemented Features

  1. CLLocationManagerDelegate

  - Missing methods:
  didEnterRegion(_:)
  didExitRegion(_:)
  didDetermineState(for:state:)
  didRangeBeacons(_:satisfying:)
  didRange(beacons:in:)
  didVisit(_:)
  didFinishDeferredUpdatesWithError(_:)
  locationManagerDidPauseLocationUpdates(_:)
  locationManagerDidResumeLocationUpdates(_:)

  2. Authorization System

  - Authorization methods immediately grant permission without actual
  checks
  - No persistent authorization state
  - Missing proper authorization flow for Linux

  3. Distance Filter

  - distanceFilter property exists but not enforced
  - Location updates don't check if device moved minimum distance

  🟠 Missing Classes/Types

  1. Location-Related

  - CLVisit - Detecting visits to locations
  - CLBeaconRegion - iBeacon monitoring
  - CLBeacon - Beacon ranging data
  - CLLocationPushServiceExtension - Push-to-location services
  - CLBackgroundActivitySession - Background activity sessions

  2. Geocoding

  - CLGeocodeCompletionHandler exists but limited implementation
  - Missing locale-specific geocoding options
  - No offline geocoding capability

  3. Monitoring Features

  - CLMonitor - Modern monitoring API (iOS 17+)
  - CLCondition - Condition-based monitoring
  - CLMonitoringEvent - Monitoring events
  - CLMonitoringRecord - Monitoring records

  🔵 Stub/Empty Implementations

  1. Heading Updates

  // These are documented as no-ops but could potentially be implemented
  startUpdatingHeading()
  stopUpdatingHeading()
  dismissHeadingCalibrationDisplay()

  2. Significant Location Changes

  startMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges()
  stopMonitoringSignificantLocationChanges()

  3. Deferred Updates

  allowDeferredLocationUpdates(untilTraveled:timeout:)
  disallowDeferredLocationUpdates()

  Simplified/mock implementation   |

  💡 Recommendations for Next Steps

  Priority 1: Improve Location Accuracy

  1. Add GPS provider for Linux (gpsd integration)
  2. Implement WiFi-based positioning
  3. Create provider selection based on desiredAccuracy

  Priority 2: Implement Distance Filter

  // Track last reported location
  // Only report if moved > distanceFilter meters

  Priority 3: Add Region Monitoring

  1. Implement monitoring logic in CLLocationManager
  2. Add background checking for region boundaries
  3. Implement delegate callbacks

  Priority 4: Persist Authorization

  1. Store authorization state
  2. Implement proper permission model for Linux

  Priority 5: Complete CLLocationManagerDelegate

  1. Add missing delegate methods
  2. Ensure proper callback patterns

  Would you like me to help implement any of these missing features?
